# California Employment and Wages Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employment and wage trends in California using the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) dataset. The data is cleaned, processed, and aggregated to provide meaningful insights into employment and wage patterns across different regions and industries.

The final cleaned dataset **is** being prepared for integration with Tableau or Power BI for interactive dashboards.

## Data Processing Summary
- Loaded the QCEW dataset and removed rows with missing data to ensure accuracy.  
- Renamed columns for clarity and converted key numerical columns to appropriate types.  
- Aggregated data by `Area_Type` to calculate sums and averages of weekly wages and monthly employment.  
- Sorted and summarized the data to identify regional employment and wage trends.  
- Exported the processed data to a CSV file for further use.

## Next Steps
